# Serve Static [files]

## Why use this?

* You have files you want to host (in a non-production environment).
* You want a stupidly simple way of serving said files that will stay alive.

## Defaults

* Port 8080
* Serves files that live in ~/static

You can change these in the docker compose file.

## Usage

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
